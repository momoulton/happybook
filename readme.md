# Mo Moulton P4: Preferential Book Selector for Book Clubs

## Live URL
<http://p4.momoulton.com>

## Description
This app allows users to organize information about their book club meetings and selected books. Most importantly, it allows them to create ballots and vote on possible book choices. The voting is conducted through preferential voting, so users rank their selections and if their first choice is eliminated their second choice gets their first-choice vote, and so on, until one book gets a majority. I wrote this algorithm myself because I couldn't find a package for it, so it's a little rough! Ties in particular are dealt with in a rough-and-ready way, by just choosing one.
